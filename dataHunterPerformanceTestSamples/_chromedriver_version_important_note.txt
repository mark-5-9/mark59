Warning:  An out-of-date release of ChromeDriver is shipped with Mark59 !
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 2.44 of the Linux and Windows ChromeDrivers are included in the Mark59 'dataHunterPerformanceTestSamples' project.

This was the last release where a check was NOT included to verify ChromeDriver was compatible with the version of Chrome 
it is driving.  This version has been used to enable the immediate execution of the Selenium tests against dataHunter in the
dataHunterPerformanceTestSamples project, particularly when running the start-up DEMO from the mark59-web-server-metrics
application.  

It saves having to ensure the ChromeDriver is compatible with the version of Chrome or Chromium on the machine running the DEMO.
Google and the ChromeDriver development team are currently updating every month or two, and the current ChromeDriver releases
only work on one version of Chrome.  

Obviously this is really just a bit of a trick, that works mainly due to the fact that dataHunter (the system under test) is
quite a simple application.  Presumably one day a Chrome release will break the 2.44 ChromeDriver, but anyway it works 
for now.

So, it is VERY IMPORTANT to update/use a current version of ChromeDriver (the most current version compatible with the Chrome/
Chromium browser you are using), before doing any serious work with Selenium.
