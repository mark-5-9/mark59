Warning:  The ChromeDriver Releases shipped with Mark59 and the Quick Start Demo 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The chromeDriver versions shipped with Mark59 may or may not work with the version of Chrome you have installed on your
machine (for example during testing for Chrome 91/92, it was found there is some leniency in Windows, but Linux always 
needed the exact matching browser version).

Even if you get away with using a slightly outdated chromedriver for the demo, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to update and use a 
current version of ChromeDriver (the most current version compatible with the Chrome/Chromium browser you are using),
before doing any serious work with Selenium.  If you are using the DevTools CDP, remember you may need to update your
import statements too.
