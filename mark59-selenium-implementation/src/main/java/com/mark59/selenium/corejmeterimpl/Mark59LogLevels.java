/**
 * Used to set actions when writing the transaction-level screenshots/logs in the Mark59 framework.<p> 
 * 
 *  <b>WRITE</b> will force output of the log type being set to the Mark59 logging directory (as set by the property "mark59.screenshot.directory").<p>
 *  <b>BUFFER</b> will keep the log data for the log type being set in memory, and will only be printed should the script fail, 
 *  or explicitly requested to by written via a  writeBufferedArtifacts() call (refer below),  otherwise the log data is cleared at the end of the script<p>
 *  <b>OFF</b> will switch off logging for the log type    
 *    
 *  <p><b>DEFAULT</b> uses these setting :
 *  <p> At Log4J Trace Level:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> 	write Screenshots At Start and End OfTransactions
 *  <li> 	write Page Source At Start and End OfTransactions	    
 *	<li>	write Performance Log At End Of Transactions	
 *  </ul>
 *  <p> At Log4j Debug Level:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>	write Screenshots End Of Transactions
 *  <li> 	write Page Source End Of Transactions	    
 *	<li>	write PerformanceLog At End Of Transactions	
 *  </ul>
 *  <p> At Log4j Info Level and above transaction-level logging is switched off (although exceptions are written).
