		<h1>Server Metrics Via Web - Overview</h1>     
		
		
		<p>Maintains a database of sever details, which can be used to enable connectivity from JMeter tests to servers for monitoring purposes during a performance test.</p>
	
		<p>This may be particularly useful when you are running a test in an environment where you do not have direct access to the application servers.</p>
		
		<p>For example, you may be running all your JMeter load generators in a cloud environment,
		 but security rules will not allow you do directly access non-Cloud servers you want to monitor.  
		 Then the Mark59 Server Metrics Via Web Application can act as a 'proxy' for you.</p>  
		

		<p>Version: 3.0.0   Please see our User Guide and more at <a href="https://mark59.com" target="_blank">mark59.com</a></p>
